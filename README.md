# Water_Potability_NeuralNetwork

As part of this project, I developed a neural network model to assess water potability based on various chemical and physical properties. The goal was to accurately predict whether water is safe for consumption using a dataset containing attributes like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, and more.

I carried out data preprocessing, including handling missing values and normalization, followed by building and training the model using a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The project includes:

A clean and reproducible neural network implementation

Visualizations for feature distributions and model evaluation (e.g., loss curves, confusion matrix)

A structured dataset split into water_train.csv and water_test.csv

The notebook Water_Potability_NeuralNetwok.ipynb detailing the full workflow

This work demonstrates how machine learning can contribute to public health by automating water quality assessments.
